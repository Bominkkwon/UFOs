## Overview

The purpose of this Project is to provide users with a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Such a data driven website needs different tools for users to search through its information; the filtering functions of this website allows users to minimize any additional engagement with the large data and gain the information they are looking for. Both, the creators and the users want to provide and get the accurate information and data effectively and efficiently, so such tools to aid the process are imperative. 

## Results

Since such table filters for the city, state, country, and shape have been added for users. A user can type in any city, i.e., “Fresno”, and find out its more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. It is especially useful since not all users would have all that information with them; therefore, any users can easily search and analyze with one (or more) of the criteria.

## Summary

One drawback of this new design would be not having separate pages for the “Filter Search” section, because having everyone on one page may not deliver the clear message or may create some confusions. So, I would add different click buttons to have the “Filter Search” lead to a new page, where users can easily copy or screenshot without the whole frontpage. Another recommendation would be adding more colors to the headline and the "p" in HTML, since the background is very dark (though I get the theme and the main photo), it is hard to read and pick up any information that is considered “more important” when all words are white and no special characterizations for any sections and it is hard to give the full attention.
